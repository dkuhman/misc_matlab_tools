# MISCELLANEOUS MATLAB TOOLS
This repository contains miscellaneous tools that I have developed for data analysis in MATLAB.

---
## Interacting with Figure Data
`interactive_find_data.m`: This function plots x,y data inputs, allows the user to brush data points on the figure, and returns the x,y data brushed. This function calls the `callback` function (also included in this repository).

`interactive_delete_test_script.m`: This script provides an example case for the `interactive_find_data()` function.

## Batch Processing Template
`multi_file_load.m`: This script provides a simple template for loading in multiple files and can be used to facilitate batch data processing.
